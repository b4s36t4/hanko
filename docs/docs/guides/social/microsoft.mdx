# Login with Microsoft

- Create and configure a Microsoft Azure Application on the Azure portal.
- Create your Microsoft OAuth Credentials and configure them with Hanko.
- Add the Hanko `<hanko-auth>` web component or add the required code to your frontend using the `hanko-frontend-sdk`.

## Access your Azure Portal

- Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
- Click on `Sign in` at the top right to log in. If you do not have an account yet, create one.

## Get your provider redirect URL {#redirect-url}

When creating an Azure Application, you need to provide a redirect URL that determines where the third party
provider redirects after a successful login. This redirect URL consists of the base URL of the Hanko API
and the [`/thirdparty/callback`](http://docs.hanko.io/api/public#tag/Third-Party/operation/thirdPartyCallback) endpoint.
Your Hanko API base URL, and therefore your redirect URL, depends on whether you use Hanko Cloud or chose to self-host
the Hanko API:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="environment">
<TabItem value="cloud" label="Hanko Cloud">
```

When using Hanko Cloud you can obtain your redirect URL from the Hanko Cloud Console:

- Sign in to [cloud.hanko.io](https://cloud.hanko.io).
- Select your `Organization`.
- Select your `Project`.
- In the left sidebar, click `Settings`, then select `Identity providers`.
- Find your redirect URL in the `Redirect URL` input.

You need the redirect URL for [creating your Azure Application](#redirect-url) in the next step.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-hosted">
```

When self-hosting your redirect URL depends on where you chose to host your Hanko API instance, i.e.
it looks like: `<your_hanko_api_url>/thirdparty/callback`.

You need the redirect URL for [creating your Azure Application](#redirect-url) in the next step and when
[configuring your microsoft credentials with Hanko](#config-hanko).

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Create a New Azure Application

- Login to the Azure portal
- Go to App Registrations section
- Click on Create Application.
- Enter your Application name.
- Under `Supported account types` choose the 3rd option i.e `Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)`.
  > The above option let any user to login to your application.
- Under ** Redirect URI ** section choose `web` as the platform and [redirect_url](#redirect-url) as the value.
- Now click on Register.

## Editing app details

- Provide necessary app information about your company by going to `Branding & properties` section in your application screen.
- We need to verify that we're setting correct scopes, by default the app would be having `User.Read` scope which is correct if not please set the scope.

:::info
When selecting the scope make sure you've selected `Microsoft Graph` as the Permission name.
:::info

## Creating Client Secret

To configure Hanko we need to create a secret.

- Open you application home page.
- Go to Certificates & Secrets
- Click on Certificates section
- Upload your Public Key under `Certificates` section.

:::info

If you don't have a certificate, you can use the following command to generate one for testing purpose.

```sh
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 3650 -nodes
```

The Above command will create two files in the current directory `key.pem` and `cert.pem`, you need to upload `cert.pem` to azure which is the public key here.
The contents of `key.pem` should be used as `client_secret` in configuration step.
:::info

> You can also use `Secrets` section to create a client secret but that would expire after certain time which isn't great for production purpose.
> For testing purpose it is recommmned to go with the generating a new secret instead of certificate

- Open you application home page.
- Go to Certificates & Secrets
- Click on `Client Secrets` section.
- Now click on `Create New Client Secret`, give it a name and the expiration time. 
- Once created copy the create client_secret and keep it with you.

> Generated client secret only available once, if we move out of the page it won't be shown again.

Now get the `client ID` from the `Overview` section of your application home page.

## Configure Microsoft credentials with Hanko {#config-hanko}

Next, you need to configure your Microsoft credentials with Hanko. Configuration differs depending on whether you
use Hanko Cloud or self-host the Hanko API:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="environment">
<TabItem value="cloud" label="Hanko Cloud">
```

When using Hanko Cloud, configure third party settings using the Hanko Cloud Console:

- Sign in to [cloud.hanko.io](https://cloud.hanko.io).
- Select your `Organization`.
- Select your `Project`.
- In the left sidebar, click `Settings`, then select `Identity providers`.
- Under `Identity provider settings` configure the following:
  - `Error redirect URL`: This is a URL in your frontend the Hanko API redirects to if an error occurs during third
    party sign-in. When [using the `hanko-elements` web components](#frontend-integration), it should be the URL of the
    page that embeds the web component such that errors can be processed properly by the web component.
  - `Allowed redirect URLs`: This is a URL in your frontend the Hanko API is allowed to redirect to after third party
    sign-in was successful. When [using the `hanko-elements` web components](#frontend-integration), it should be the
    URL of the page that embeds the web component.
    - _**Note**_: supports wildcard matching through globbing:
      - `https://*.example.com` will allow `https://foo.example.com` and `https://bar.example.com` to be accepted.
      - `https://foo.example.com/*` will match `https://foo.example.com/page1`
        and `https://foo.example.com/page2`.
      - `**` acts as a "super"-wildcard/match-all.
- Find and expand the `Microsoft` provider panel in the `Providers` list.
- Enable the provider by clicking the toggle switch.
- Enter your `Client ID` and `Client secret`.
- Click `Save`.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-hosted">
```

When self-hosting you need to adjust your backend
[configuration file](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/blob/main/backend/config/config.yaml). You must provide
the following data:

- your provider [`redirect_url`](#redirect-url)
- your [`client ID`](#complete-app)
- your client [`secret`](#complete-app)
- an `error_redirect_url`: This is a URL in your frontend the Hanko API redirects to if an error occurs during third
  party sign-in. When [using the `hanko-elements` web components](#frontend-integration), it should be the URL of the
  page that embeds the web component such that errors can be processed properly by the web component.
- an `allowed_redirect_url`: This is a URL in your frontend the Hanko API is allowed to redirect to after third
  party sign-in was successful. When [using the `hanko-elements` web components](#frontend-integration), it should be
  the URL of the page that embeds the web component.
  - _**Note**_: supports wildcard matching through globbing:
    - `https://*.example.com` will allow `https://foo.example.com` and `https://bar.example.com` to be accepted.
    - `https://foo.example.com/*` will match `https://foo.example.com/page1`
      and `https://foo.example.com/page2`.
    - `**` acts as a "super"-wildcard/match-all.

Open up your configuration file and add the following:

```yaml title=config.yaml
third_party:
  # You do not have to add this URL to the 'allowed_redirect_urls', it is automatically included when
  # validating redirect URLs.
  #
  # NOTE: URLs MUST NOT have trailing slash
  error_redirect_url: <your_error_redirect_url>
  # NOTE: URLs in the list MUST NOT have trailing slash
  allowed_redirect_urls:
    - <your_allowed_redirect_url>
  redirect_url: <your_provider_redirect_url>
  providers:
    microsoft:
      enabled: true
      client_id: <your_microsoft_client_id>
      secret: <your_microsoft_client_secret> # This can be also the private key
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Enable login in your frontend app {#frontend-integration}

Frontend integration depends on whether you intend to use a pre-built UI as provided by the
[`@teamhanko/hanko-elements`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamhanko/hanko-elements) package or prefer building
a custom UI using the [`@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk).

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="elements" label="Hanko Elements">
```

Depending on what framework your frontend uses, integrate the `<hanko-auth>` web component from the `hanko-elements`
package according to one of our [frontend guides](/guides/frontend). If everything was successful, the component should
now render a button for signing in with `Microsoft` on the login view.

:::info

Make sure to [configure](#config-hanko) the page the web component is embedded on as your error redirect URL
as well as an allowed redirect URL.

:::

On successful authentication with the third party provider, the backend issues a session cookie and the web component
continues the usual component flow on success. Errors that occur during third party
provider authentication are also picked up and displayed in the web component accordingly.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sdk" label="Hanko Frontend SDK">
```

When building your own UI, you can use the `@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk` to initialize third party sign in.
Create a [`Hanko` client](https://docs.hanko.io/jsdoc/hanko-frontend-sdk/Hanko.html) instance and call `thirdParty.auth`
with `microsoft` as your provider and the target URL in your app you want to redirect to
after successful third party authentication (must be [configured](#config-hanko) as an allowed redirect URL).
Doing so first redirects you to the third party provider, where you then will be prompted
to authenticate and provide consent for the API to access your data.

```js showLineNumbers
import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk";

const hanko = new Hanko("<your_hanko_api_url>");

async function signInWithMicrosoft() {
  try {
    await hanko.thirdParty.auth("microsoft", "<your_redirect_url>");
  } catch (error) {
    // handle error
  }
}
```

On successful authentication with the third party provider, the API redirects you to the given redirect URL. The
URL query includes a one time token that must be exchanged for a JWT. Use the `token.validate`
method on your client to validate the token:

```js showLineNumbers
import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk";

const hanko = new Hanko("<your_hanko_api_url>");

async function onLoad() {
  try {
    await hanko.token.validate();
  } catch (error) {
    // handle error
  }

  // you should now have a JWT cookie set
}
```

On success, the API issues a JWT which is then set by the SDK as a cookie (`hanko`). All other SDK methods can now
use the cookie to make authenticated requests to the API.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::info

If you are self-hosting and your frontend application runs on a different domain than the Hanko API, make sure to

- enable session token propagation via header manually by setting `session.enable_auth_token_header` to `true` in your
  configuration, so that session cookies can be set client-side.
- include your frontend domain in the `server.public.cors.allowed_origins` in your
  [configuration](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/blob/main/backend/docs/Config.md).
